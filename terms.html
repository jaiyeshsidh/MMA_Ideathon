                                        We fully support appropriate behaviour by all Participants at the Hackathon,
                                        including during any and all official and unofficial activities. We expect all
                                        attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers, and staff to help us make the the
                                        Hackathon a place that welcomes and respects all Participants, regardless of race,
                                        
                                        gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, national origin,
                                        ethnicity, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of Participants in person,
                                        online, or in any other form.

                                        Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or
                                        demands, overly sexualised images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking,
                                        harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or
                                        Hackathons, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention.

                                        We expect all Participants - attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers - to
                                        follow the Code of Conduct during the Hackathon. This includes conference-
                                        related social Hackathons at off-site locations, and in related online communities
                                        and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected
                                        to comply immediately.

                                        We thank our Participants for your help in keeping the Hackathon welcoming,
                                        respectful, and friendly to all Participants.

                                        The Organiser is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
                                        everyone. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age,
                                        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
                                        nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
                                        stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable
                                        consent, sustained disruption of talks or other Hackathons, inappropriate physical
                                        contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Overly sexual language and imagery is
                                        
                                        not appropriate at the venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social
                                        media and other online media.

                                        Photography is encouraged, but other Participants must be given a reasonable
                                        chance to refuse being photographed. If they object to being photographed,
                                        comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts
                                        where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy e.g. in bathrooms or
                                        where Participants are sleeping.

                                        Hacks created at our Hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment
                                        policy.
                                </li>

                                        Participants whom asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to
                                        comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
                                        harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organising
                                        committee immediately.

                                        The Organiser will happily help Participants contact any local security or local
                                        law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe
                                        for the duration of the Hackathon.

                                        Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
                                        Hackathon at the discretion of the Organiser. If a Participant engages in harassing
                                        behaviour, the Organizer may take any action they deem appropriate, including
                                        warning the offender or expulsion from the venue.

                                        For the avoidance of doubt, a Participant will grant the Organiser a right of first
                                        refusal for the acquisition or any exclusive license for all materials including
                                        software, source code, documentation, data, and concepts (whether created or
                                        developed independently by a Participant or jointly with others) (“Materials”)
                                        submitted to the Organiser during the Hackathon, for a period of 6 months
                                        following the conclusion of the Hackathon. During this period, the Participant may
                                        not sell, transfer, or license exclusively their intellectual property rights to a third
                                        party, without first offering the Organiser the opportunity to acquire or license the
                                        Materials on the same terms and conditions offered by the third party, whereby
                                        the Organiser will have 30 days to accept the Participant’s offer. If the Organiser
                                        does not accept the Participant’s offer within 30 days, the Participant will have the
                                        right to accept the third party’s offer.

                                        The Participants expressly authorise the Organiser, to publish, to communicate,
                                        to expose and to disclose, divulgate and represent the submitted ideas verbally,
                                        graphically or in writing, in any medium worldwide and without restrictions in
                                        time, and by any means, either present or future, free of charge, in relation to this
                                        Hackathon.

                                        The results shall, in no Hackathon, infringe in any manner or induce
                                        infringement of any third party intellectual property rights. Should the right from
                                        identified third party right owner not be commercially available, the result may
                                        not be qualified to win the prize. The Participant undertakes to indemnify the
                                        Organiser against all claims asserted by third-parties against the Organiser due to
                                        an actual or alleged infringement of rights resulting from the use of the result, as
                                        
                                        well as against all litigation costs (including reasonable attorney fees) required to
                                        defend the Organiser against such claims, unless the Organiser itself is
                                        responsible for the infringement of rights by its gross negligence or wilful
                                        misconduct.
